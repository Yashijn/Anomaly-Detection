During the lockdown, we have ensured continued supply to customers strictly following Government guidelines,"" the company said in a BSE filing.AEL said it continued its operations in mines even in the first stage of lockdown, as supply of coal falls under exemption category with safety and wellbeing of workers and staff given utmost priority.Close    COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions   View more        How does a vaccine work?  A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.    How many types of vaccines are there?  There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.    What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind?  Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.

With further relaxations being given in the month of May, we have furthered the operations in the phased manner, strictly adhering to government guidelines and ensuring safety and well-being of our employees,"" it said.About financial impact on operations, it said coal supplies were continuous to State Electricity Boards (SEBs) during this period but overall demand was impacted due to lesser power demand and excess domestic cargo being available at coal mines.""Our sales volumes are expected to be impacted in Q1 FY21. Also margins are expected to be slightly lower in the short run due to excess flow of supply in the market,"" the company said.About mining services, it said that power demand and consequent coal demand was partially impacted in Rajasthan during the lockdown.Post easing, demand of power has gone up and demand of coal is expected to be back to normal, it said.""We expect to maintain healthy level of volumes despite above aberrations. Since this is contract business, the company does not carry any pricing risk,"" it added.

In the last 15 days, Adani Total Gas, Adani Enterprises and Adani Transmission gained 23 percent, 14 percent and 8 percent respectively. In the last 30 days, these stocks rallied 59 percent, 24 percent and 16 percent respectively, while the gains stood at 206 percent, 114 percent and 98 percent respectively in the last 60 days.""The Adani Group of stocks which we highlighted in our potential MSCI Standard Index Inclusion names on April 1, which has run up a lot are still qualifying to get included in May Review,"" said Edelweiss.MSCI has given an excessive returns threshold for inclusion and even after considering simple returns (without excessive returns to benchmark stocks), the price move in Adani Total Gas, Adani Enterprises and Adani Transmission are far lower than the threshold set by the Index provider, the brokerage added.Close  Related stories Heads up!

Such securities would be re-evaluated for Standard Index inclusion in the subsequent Index Review using Standard Index inclusion criteria, including the return-based thresholds for the extreme price increase.- MSCI will evaluate the 5-day to 60-day excess returns, in increments of 5 days, as of the price cut off date of the index review, for additions to the Standard indexes. As shown in the table below, securities with excess returns above 100 percent for any of its 5-day to 20-day excess returns, or above 200 percent for any of its 25-day to 40-day excess returns or 400 percent for any of its 45-day to 60-day excess returns are considered to exhibit extreme price increase.- Excess return is calculated as the difference between the return of security for the relevant period and the average return of IMI constituents belonging to the same country-sector where the security is classified (in terms of country of classification and GICS classification at the sector level). For country-sectors that have five or fewer IMI constituents, the relevant country IMI return is used instead.MSCI is expected to conduct its semi-annual review of its MSCI Standard Index on May 12, 2021.Edelweiss has considered $50 billion as the MSCI benchmarked assets under management (AUM) for its analysis and the adjustment date would be May 27, 2021.""As per our best understanding, the cut-off date which MSCI index will consider to filter the stocks for the purpose of rebalancing should be any day between April 19-23,"" said the brokerage.Cholamandalam Investment is also expected to be added to the MSCI Standard Index, though the conviction is medium to low. On the other side,  is likely to be excluded from the said index.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment expert on Moneycontrol.com are his own and not that of the website or its management.
